# ðŸ”¬ F-Society!
## F-Society inspired by a tv show "Mr. Robot" i am making a simple tool which will help CTF players and hackers in their, well CTF and hacks haha surprise!

#
How to run? Well you gotta have python installed
```bash
python3 FSociety.py
```
You might face some dependency error while running to fix that just do
```bash
pip3 install <dependency name>
```
FSociety currently have 5 working features like
#
1. Backdoors - FSociety can generate pyc files which will help hackers to gain a reverse shell access we are still working to make the pyc file compile into a working executable! ðŸ”¨ Features of This backdoor it can get screenshot of the target pc can execute commands can upload stuffs and can download stuffs too! 
2. Reverse Shells - FSociety have one liner reverse shells too although they are laggy but they are managable because once you get into the box well you can do whatever right? xD i don't wanna spoil your CTF experience so i'll let you all figure it out and FSociety doesn't use any external servers like netcat or any others we have our own basic reverse shell server side code â›µ
3. Port Scanner - FSociety have multi threaded port scanner which will.... well scan ports right? I guess but basically it will look for open ports in a box given its IP Address and the port range ðŸ’«
4. MAC Address Changer - FSociety have a simple tool which will help hackers to change their MAC address given the interface which you wannna interfare with! ðŸ¤ 
5. Data Encryptor - FSociety have a data encryptor too which will encrypt any data you want and the secret key is prompted on the fly so no trace of the secret key and if you forget it haha then you can't get your data back (That's Kinda Dangerous Tho) ðŸ—¿
